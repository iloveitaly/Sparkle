This project is a fork of [Sparkle](https://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle)

# Customizations
This fork off of [Sparkle](https://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle) does *not* ask for
permission to download and install a update. Of course, this is not good practice in any user facing application.  

In a controller envoirnment where you own + control all machines running an application and would like an easy way to push updates out to clients, this is a perfect solution.

Refer to master fork's readme for more information about sparkle.
